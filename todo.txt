- Implement client functionality to handlers
    - write integration tests for endpoints. (cont: running to validate service)
- start thinking on algo to server IPC / comms
- cloud SQL postegress storage
- order manager?
- portfolio manager?
- failover handler?
- Python client
    - Value assignment (100 dollar)
    - effiency calculator
- Backtester
- ML lib / framework stuff



Design Decisions:
- I will start by creating a microservice approach
    - golang webserver, handles binance comms, order management, etc
    - python algo executioners, feeds on data streams, sends buy / sell commands
- Why: Learning microservices, golang webservice, postgres, designing and creating my own system
